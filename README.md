# MNIST_LSTM
This notebook presents a deep learning assignment for building and evaluating LSTM-based models to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The main objective is to treat each MNIST image (28Ã—28 pixels) as a sequence of 28 time steps with 28 features and train a model using LSTM layers.
